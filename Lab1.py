# comparison operators compare values on both sides and return a True or False statement
# They are extensively used for making decisions in flowcharts, conditional statements

#Equality operator, Equality operators are used to check for specific values

#Assignment operators
#Addition, subtraction and mulitplication can be done within the line as follows
    
x+= 4 # the value of 4 is added to x and the value is stored into the variable. 

#So, in this case, value of x should be updated to 16

x-= 4       # 4 would be subtracted and saved in x, so, the value must return to 12
print (x)

x*= 4
print (x)   # 4 would be multiplied to value of x, so, the returned value would be 48

# The same can be extended to division, modulus and exponent
# using /=, %=, **= the same can be achieved

# logical operators

#And operator, compares the logical values of the variables and returns true if the values are equal
# Returns a false value if the values are not equal. Python is case sensitive. 

a = True
b = False

# True is returned when both a and b are true or both a and b are false
print (a and b) # Returned value would be false

# or operator returns a true if atleast one of the variables is a true
